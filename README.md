Aim: To start learning python

Theory: Undertsanding the working of string, double qoutes, variibales, numerical,naming,comments, etc in python.

We learnt the use of the print() function for displaying output and the importance of quotation marks for strings were clearly demonstrated. Additionally,
the role of comments in making code more readable was observed.This experiment helped us in understanding the basic syntax.


Conclusion: This experiment helped in understanding the basic syntax and core concepts of Python programming. 
We learned how to declare and use variables of different data types such as integers, strings, and lists.
